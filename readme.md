# frobiac Userspace

This directory contains common layout components and features for my various keyboards.

Its structure is inspired by two approaches
* via Configurator and JSON, see @paperfilter
* via C code, see @curry

The custom boards have been supported by my original firmware so far.
Below 'keyboards/frobiac' there will be their port to QMK.
In order to make my personal layout usable with other community driven designs
this userspace contains shared code and defines.
